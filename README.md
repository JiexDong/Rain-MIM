# Rain-MIM
AH-Rain is an original dataset introduced for the first time in this study. The data was collected within Anhui Province, China, covering a spatial range from 27°N to 36°N latitude and from 113°E to 121°E longitude. It has a temporal resolution of 6 minutes and a spatial resolution of 0.01°×0.01°, with each radar echo image having a resolution of 800×900 pixels. S-band radar was used to collect data at nine elevation angles per volume scan. The composite reflectivity, which represents the maximum value among the nine elevation angles at the same azimuth and distance, was obtained. The data was collected over the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. Examples of AH-Rain samples are as follows:
